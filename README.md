# cocoapods-developing-folder

A cocoapods plugin  provide a branch of tools for who heavily use development pods in project:

- Availability to preserves the folder structure in `development pods`
- Provides a new keyword `folder` to import all local pods in a specific folder and its subfolders
- Function to inhibit warnings for specific pods with a block.


## Installation

    $ gem install cocoapods-developing-folder

## Usage

#### ðŸ”¸ Preserves the folder structure

Add the following to your podfile

```ruby
plugin 'cocoapods-developing-folder'
use_folders
```

If you don't want to create groups for top level folders (Local pods are usually grouped in the same folder):
```ruby
use_folders :skip_top_level_group => ["modules"]
```

#### ðŸ”¸ Import all local pods in specific folder

Use `folder` just like `pod` keyword. (In fact, they are just ruby functions)


```ruby
plugin 'cocoapods-developing-folder'

target "ABC" do 
    pod "SnapKit"
    folder "frameworks/core" # 'frameworks/core' is just a relative path to podfile
    folder "modules"         #  it will import all pod in 'modules' folder and its subfolders
end
```

It will import all local pods in that folder and its subfolders recrusively, equivalent of:

```
pod "Ayanami", :path => "modules/Ayanami"
pod "Asuka",   :path => "modules/Asuka"
pod "Shinji",  :path => "modules/some/path/to/Shinji"
#...
```

#### ðŸ”¸ Inhibit warnings for specific pods

Add the following to your podfile

```ruby
plugin 'cocoapods-developing-folder'

inhibit_warnings_with_condition do |pod_name, pod_target|
    # your condition written in ruby, like:
    # `not pod_name.start_with? "LE"` or
    # `['Asuka', 'Ayanami', 'Shinji'].include? pod_name`
end
```
`pod_target` is a instance of `Pod::PodTarget` [class](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/93011ece10dd76b8d783bc80db742dfd03f7cbac/lib/cocoapods/target/pod_target.rb), containing many more info than the name. You can use it to set up complex rules.

This function will override the warning inhibition settings by the original methods, like: `inhibit_all_warnings!`, `pod 'Ayanami', :inhibit_warnings => true`

This function is usually used for disabling warning inhibition for development pods and enabling for the others. When you try to implement this with offical methods, cocoapods may warn you at `pod install`:

> The pod #{pod_name} is linked to different targets which contain different settings to inhibit warnings. CocoaPods does not currently support different settings and will fall back to your preference set in the root target definition.

This function solve the problem.
